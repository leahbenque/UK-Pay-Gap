# Pay Gap in the United Kingdom
In April 2024, the gender pay gap in the United Kingdom was at 7% for full-time employees. In the last decade, it has been slowly declining. In this analysis, I utilize SQL to investigate the gender pay gap in the United Kingdom during the Covid-19 crisis, from 2021-2022. Since the median is generally preferred over the mean in these studies for better representing the average employee, I used that measure. The data was retrieved from Gov.UK. I also retrieved detailed location and siccode (industry classification) information. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09a93a69-b59f-4874-a87e-24aaedb704b6)
