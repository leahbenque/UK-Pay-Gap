# Pay Gap in the United Kingdom
In April 2024, the gender pay gap in the United Kingdom was at 7% for full-time employees. In the last decade, it has been slowly declining. In this analysis, I utilize SQL to investigate the gender pay gap in the United Kingdom during the Covid-19 crisis, from 2021-2022. Since the median is generally preferred over the mean in these studies for better representing the average employee, I used that measure. The data was retrieved from [Gov.UK](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/). I also retrieved detailed [location](https://github.com/radiac/UK-Postcodes/blob/master/postcodes.csv) and [siccode](https://resources.companieshouse.gov.uk/sic/) (industry classification) information.
